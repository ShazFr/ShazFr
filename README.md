### 👨‍💻 About Me

🎮 After 4 years in the game development industry, building international games with Unity and C#, giving talks, and even winning awards, I decided it was time for a change.

📉 While I loved creating games, the industry didn’t offer the kind of growth, stability, and learning curve I was looking for. That led me to backend development, where I found the perfect blend of structure, creativity, and engineering challenges.

🛠️ I’ve since transitioned into backend engineering with Golang, building full-stack projects with Gin, Fiber, GORM, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Docker. I'm obsessed with clean code, fast APIs, and scalable design.

💼 I'm now actively looking for a full-time backend role (remote preferred I spent a lot on the standing desk before getting laid off for the 3rd time)
ideally at a fast-moving startup where I can contribute meaningfully, learn fast, and grow with the team.
